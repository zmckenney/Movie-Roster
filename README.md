# Movie Roster  
My first full app I ever built.  The code is terrible and hard to follow but as an exercise in learning what NOT to do I've started overhauling some things and leaving others as-is.  

# Description  
An app to find popular and new movies using TheMovieDB.org's API as well as favoriting.  

# How to clone and run this app  
Clone the project  
Create a file in the app module called apikeys.properties  
Add a single line in the file as such:   tmdbKey = "ENTER_YOUR_TMDB_KEY_HERE"  
Run!
